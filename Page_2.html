    <h1><b><u>Hypothesis</u></b></h1>
        <p>We believe that: <br> Students who practice blind typing for at least 30 minutes <br> a day will significantly improve their typing speed and accuracy <br> within two weeks, compared to those who do not.</p>
        <p>This hypothesis will be tested through observation and practice sessions to measure <br> real improvement in performance. Testing imrpovement rate of someone with no foundation <br> in typing will be higher than of someone who has been freehand <br> typing</p>
    <h1>This section will put information abt hypothesis</h1>
    <h1><u>Research Questions</u></h1>
    <h2>1. Can someone with no typing experience learn touch typing faster than someone who experience in freehand typing?</h2>
    <p>Yes, in many cases, beginners can learn touch typing faster. Beginners don't have incorrect muscle memory or bad form to unlearn, they also follow the proper mthod from day one, building clean and consistent habits.</p>
    <h2>2. Does an experienced typist face a plateau while an inexperienced typist shows exponential growth?</h2>
    <p>Some what yes. Freehand typists might hit a plateau early. THeir existing method only gets them so far. Switching to touch typing feels like going backwards, which discourages them. New learners often show faster initial growth becasue every sesson brings noticeable progress.</p>
    <h2>Does muscle memory or cognitive familiarty influence speed gains?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The more a person trains their fingers to hit the correct keys automatically, the faster the more fluid their typing becomes. Touch typing is mostly about building this kind of muscle memory.</p>
