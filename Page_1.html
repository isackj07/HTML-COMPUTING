    <h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
        <p>This hands-on case study investigates how quickly someone with no foundation in <br> typing can improve in touch typing when compared against someone with experience <br> in <em>freehand</em> typing in terms of <b>typing speed</b> and <b>accuracy</b>, over a <br> structured 5 day training program. We evaluate <b>improvement rate</b>, <b>error rates</b>,and<br><b>consistency</b>. Through structured <b>daily practice</b>, based on metrics such as <b>words per <br> minute (WPM)</b>, and <b>typing accuracy</b>, we aim to gain insights into learning curves, <br> plateau phases, and motivational aspects of touch typing. </p>
    <h1><b>What is blind typing?</b></h1>
        <p>Blind typing, also known as touch typing, is the skill of typing on a keyboard without looking at the keyboard. It involves memorizing the position of keys and relying on muscle memory to type quicky and accurately. This method improves <b>typing speed</b> and <b>efficiency</b>, as it allows users to focus on the screen. Blind typing is commonly taught through practice exercises and typing software, and it's a valuable skill for students, professionals, and anyone who uses a computer regularly.</p>
