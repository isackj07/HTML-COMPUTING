        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Control variables</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each participant used their laptop with <b>QWERTY</b> keyboard layout</li>
            <li>Each participant practices for Â±15 MINUTES everyday</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Data collection</h2>
        <h3>1. Quantitative Data</h3>
        <p>Quantitative data provides measurable and objective evidence to evaluate typing performance over time. 
            <br>The following key metrics are essential for tracking progress and validating our findings</p>
        <ul>
        <li><b>WPM SCORE</b></li>
        <p>This measures <b>typing speed</b>, indicating how many words a person can type within a minute. <br>
            It's a critical benchmark for assessing improvement, especially when comparing the performance of beginners versus experienced typists.<br>
            Increases in WPM directly reflect enhanced typing fluency and efficiency.</p>
        <li><b>TYPING ACCURACY</b></li>
        <p>Accuracy represents the <b>percentage of correctly typed characters or words.</b> A high WPM score is meaningless without accuracy; therefore,<br>
            this metric ensures that speed is not achieved at the cost of correctness. It's essential for identifying whether users are typing quickly <b>and</b> correctly.</p>
        <li><b>ERROR RATE</b></li>
        <p>Error rate measures the <b>frequency of mistakes made during typing</b>. It helps identify patterns in errors, such as common typos or miskeyed letters.<br>
            A lower error rate indicates better mastery of the keyboard layout and improved muscle memory.</p>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Strategies for Minimizing Errors</h2>
        <h3>1. Proper technique</h3>
        <p>Using correct posture, finger placement, and hand positioning is essential for building accurate muscle memory. <br>
            Without proper technique, participants may develop bad habits that lead to more errors and hinder progress. <br>
            Ensuring a solid foundation helps users type more accurately and consistently over time.</p>

        <h3>2. Psychological</h3>
        <p>Mental state plays a significant role in typing performance. Fatigue, stress, or frustration can cause inconsistency <br>
            and higher error rates during sessions. In short, the more you type in this state, the more likely you are to make mistakes.<br>
        <b>This is also known as being "tilted".</b></p>

        <h3>3. Applying uniform measurement standards to assess development</h3>
        <P>Consistent use of standardized metrics (e.g., WPM, accuracy, error rate) ensures that all participants are evaluated fairly and objectively. <br>
            Changing the way performance is measured between sessions can introduce errors or bias into the analysis. By sticking to the same evaluation criteria,<br>
             we can track genuine progress and compare results accurately across participants and time.</P>
